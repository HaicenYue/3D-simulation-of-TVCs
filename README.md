# 3D-simulation-of-TVCs
- This is the code used for the Paper: Supracellular organization confers directionality and mechanical potency to migrating pairs of cardiopharyngeal progenitor cells

- Our simulations are run using Software CompuCell3D 3.7.8. It is not guaranteed to work for other versions of the software. 
- We run simulations under many different conditions but there are only four main structures for the code, shown in these four subfolders. The other simulations can be easily run by changing parameters and adding or deleting cells based on one of these four structures of code. 
- If you have any difficulties runing the code or getting the same results, you can contact the author of the paper
